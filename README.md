# Hangman
Hangman.
For this project, your mission is to write a program that plays the game of Hangman. So cool, huh?

Objectives.
The project is structured to sharpen your knowledge with functions, strings, lists and dictionaries,  programing designs, problem solving, code reusability, and development.
You can extend your program to use files, multiple classes and even graphics. The main program is however basic without the extensions.

How to play.
When the user plays Hangman, the computer first selects a secret word at random from a list built into the program. The program then prints out a row of dashes—one for each letter in the secret word—and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess.
The user keeps guessing letters until either:
the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word or
 the user has made eight incorrect guesses.
Two sample runs that illustrate the play of the game are shown in Figure 1 on the next page. When it is played by children, the real fascination (a somewhat morbid fascination, I suppose) from Hangman comes from the fact that incorrect guesses are recorded by drawing an evolving picture of the user being hanged at a scaffold. For each incorrect guess, a new part of a stick-figure body—first the head, then the body, then each arm, each leg, and finally each foot—is added to the scaffold until the hanging is complete. For example, the three diagrams below show the drawing after the first incorrect guess (just the head), the third (the head, body, and left arm), and the diagram at the tragic end of a losing game:
